Small school project extension meant to replace words in a tab with other words. W.I.P.

Made for Firefox Quantum

Based on the code for the Emoji-Substitution extension over at https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/emoji-substitution. If you are new to extensions (like myself :P), it can be a really helpful resourse to learn how they work: go check it out!
